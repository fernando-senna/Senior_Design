The Eye Tracker will provide the necessary protection to the user while operating the system. Since the systems uses numerous electrical components, the user shall be protected from any electrical shocks, short circuit, or any other electrical issue. In order for the Eye Tracker to operate, it needs an IR LED to track the pupil; this system shall only implement IR LEDs that will not cause any harm to the human eye. Finally, the Eye Tracker will provide the necessary protection to the user in case the electronic components begin to overheat.
