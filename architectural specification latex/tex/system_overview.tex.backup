%This section should describe the overall structure of your software system. Think of it as the strategy for how you will build the system. An architectural "layer" is the top-level logical view, or an abstraction, of your design. Layers should be composed of related elements of similar capabilities, and should be highly independent of other layers, but should have very clearly defined interfaces and interactions with other layers. Each layer should be identified individually and should be unique as to its function and purpose within the system. This section should also contain the high-level block diagram of the layers, as shown in the example below, as well as detailed descriptions of the functions of each layer.
The system consists of three major layers. The Daughter board is the main interface between the MIPI camera module and the Cypress CX3. It contains the OmniVision 5640 sensor that interfaces to the cypress CX3.

\subsection{Software Layer Description}
Each layer should be described separately in detail. Descriptions should include the features, functions, critical interfaces and interactions of the layer. The description should clearly define the services that the layer provides. Also include any conventions that your team will use in describing the structure: naming conventions for layers, subsystems, modules, and data flows; interface specifications; how layers and subsystems are defined; etc. 

\subsection{Daughter Board Description}
Each layer should be described separately in detail. Descriptions should include the features, functions, critical interfaces and interactions of the layer. The description should clearly define the services that the layer provides. Also include any conventions that your team will use in describing the structure: naming conventions for layers, subsystems, modules, and data flows; interface specifications; how layers and subsystems are defined; etc.
